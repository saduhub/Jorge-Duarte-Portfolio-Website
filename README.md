# Jorge Duarte Developer Portfolio

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to solidify my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I was to build a developer portfolio website from scratch using my knowledge of HTML and CSS. Additionaly, this challenge allowed me to continue to practice Git flow. I also learned about css grid and the importance of wireframes when it comes to visualizing the project overall. Learning about responsiveness and media queries was also crucial for completing this project.
